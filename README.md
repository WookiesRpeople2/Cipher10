# Cipher 10

## Tech StackðŸ–¥:
- python
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [cipher 10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

this time i used the cipher 10 data set as well as using a convolutional network or else it would take a very very long time to train the models and the training wouldn't be as good.

for pytorch the data can be downloaded and saved using the file download.py

thank you for checking out this project and i hope you enjoyed
